Compile gemtek_mathlib.c: 
    gcc -c ./src/gemtek_mathlib.c

        -c: Compile and assemble, but do not link.

Bundle all object files into one static library. 
    ar cr ./lib/gemtek_mahlib.a gemtek_mathlib.o

        ar: create a static library or to add additional object files to an existing static library.
        c:  create the library if it doesn't already exist.
        r: insert object files or replace existing object files in the library, with the new object files.
    
* Optional
After an archive is created or modified, there is a need to index it. 
This index is later used by the compiler to speed up symbol-lookup inside the library and to make sure that 
the order of the symbols in the library will not matter during compilation. 
    ranlib ./lib/gemtek_mahlib.a


compile main.c
    gcc main.c -l:gemtek_mahlib.a -o main -I./inc -L./lib
        '-L:' : Specifies non standard lib
        '-l:' : link with static libraries
        '-I'  : Specifies included dir
