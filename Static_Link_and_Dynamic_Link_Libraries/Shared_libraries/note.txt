***
- Library that acan be linked by dynamic linker when proocess is loaded
into memory (.so) (libc.so)
- Exixt on the taget devive and loaded 1 times into the shared Library
- Pro: Any changes to the shared library do not require
the program that link into it to be recompiled.
- Con: require .so to be on the taget platform

* Independent-code
- Should be compiled as position-independent code (-fpic/-fPIC)
(being placed somewhere in the primary memory (real memory), executes properly regardless of its absolute address
->not tied to a specific address->can be loaded at different addresses in different processes.)

- Global Offset table
    + Table of run-time addresses of dynamic linked functions

- -fpic: there is a limit on the size of the global offset table (limit depend on machine)
    -> when conpile excess the limit -> Error
- -fPIC: no limit of global offset table
    -> Alway works, but not as small as fast as fpic

* Namming
- Real name: libname.so.x.y.z
    + x = major version
    + y = minor version
    + z = patch version
        Ex: libjpeg.so.8.2.2

- Shared Object name (soname)
    + lable for a major version of a shared object 
    + A symbol name that point to the real name 
        Ex: libjpeg.so.8

- Linker name: name of the shared lib that invoke when linking the shared lib 
    - -lname

*******************
Compile .c source file with -fpic flag (Position Independent Code generation)
    gcc -fpic -c ./src/gemtek_mathlib.c

Building C dynamic lib:
    gcc -o ./lib/gemtek_mathlib.so.1.2.3 gemtek_mathlib.o -shared -Wl,-soname,gemtek_mathlib.so.1
    (Look at the soname: readelf -a ./lib/gemtek_mathlib.so.1.2.3 | grep soname)

Create symbolic name and link to real file
    ln -s $(pwd)/lib/gemtek_mathlib.so.1.2.3 ./lib/gemtek_mathlib.so.1
    (check symbolic: file ./lib/gemtek_mathlib.so.1)

Create real name and link to real file
    ln -s $(pwd)/lib/gemtek_mathlib.so.1 ./lib/gemtek_mathlib.so

Append lib path to the environment variable:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    (check if appended: echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

Export the variable:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

compile main.c:
    gcc main.c -l:gemtek_mathlib.so -o main -I./inc -L./lib
    (check dynamicly linked: file main
     check dependency: readelf -a main | grep Shared)
